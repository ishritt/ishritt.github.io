					<h3>Machine Learning and Data Science</h3>
				</header>
				
				<p>I was introduced to this field by an assistant professor of Data Science in the Department of Management Studies at our institution after i approached him owing to my interest in Data Science. As it is a vast field of study, i am still developing my skill set pertaining to this field. A few relevant areas where i have been working on include:</p>
				<p>Python 3.x for Data Science including adequate practice of Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and other libraries<br />
				Tensor flow<br />
				Anaconda for Machine Learning</p>

					<h3>Web Development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>It was only after i had practiced Android Application development, I felt the need for the creation of database management system and required API calls to be an integral part of the android application. Hence, I went on to study basic Front-end Development as well as Back-end Development for deeper knowledge and eventually, it generated more interest than App development.
				<br /> Besides, making an interactive resume was in my bucket list from a long way back.<br /> 
					Technologies that I have worked with include: <br />HTML5 and CSS <br />XML <br/>JavaScript
				<br />Node.js <br />PostgreSQL <br/>Postman API tester <br />Static website development using Jekyll</p>

					<h3>App Development</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This was my first step towards development. Owing to preparations related to a hackathon, I completed App development courses of Google at Udacity, an online portal for free education in a matter of days and developed some practice personalized apps for me. The software and languages that i primarily used were:
					<br />Android Studio
					<br />Java 8
					<br />XML</p>

					<h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Although last in this list, this is my favorite pass time as it involves using various mathematical concepts while programming solutions to various types of questions on various websites. I tend to use the following languages while framing a solution:
					<br />C++
					<br />C
					<br />Java 8
					<br />Pyhton 3.x</p>
